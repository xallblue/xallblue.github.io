Localtunnel allows you to easily share a web service on your local development machine without messing with DNS and firewall settings.

Localtunnel will assign you a unique publicly accessible url that will proxy all requests to your locally running webserver.
Quickstart

Install Localtunnel globally (requires NodeJS) to make it accessible anywhere:

npm install -g localtunnel

Start a webserver on some local port (eg http://localhost:8000) and use the command line interface to request a tunnel to your local server:

lt --port 8000

You will receive a url, for example https://gqgh.localtunnel.me, that you can share with anyone for as long as your local instance of lt remains active. Any requests will be routed to your local service at the specified port.
